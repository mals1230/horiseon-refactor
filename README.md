# horiseon-refactor

##
My job for this challenge was to refactor the existing code to make it more accessible. I was given a starter code, and I replaced and organized all the non-semantic elements with semantic elements such as header, body, nav, etc. I then added alternative captions to the photos so that all types of visitors will know exactly what is on the screen.

On the backend, I cleaned up the HTML and CSS files with properties that were either unnecessary or duplicated.

One of the main challenges that I faced here was merging to GitHub. I'm still trying to get the hang of it and I will be scheduling a tutoring session to deep dive into it.
